We first create a max heap (largest element at the top) for the first million numbers.

Then, we traverse through the list. On each element, we insert it into the list and delete the largest element.

At the end of the traversal, we will have a heap containing the smallest one million numbers. This algorithm is 0(n log(m)), where m is the number of values we are looking for.
