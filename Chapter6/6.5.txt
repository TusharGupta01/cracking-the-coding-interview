Building of 100 floors

Find the floor from and above which the egg will break

Number of drops in the Worst Case

Lets do an incremental traversal by the counter of 10 i.e drop from 10 and then 20 and so on

1
10
20
30
40
50
60
70
80
90
Start Binary Search from here till the 100th. As chances are it will be in between only

95
97
99
100

Where each of the number represent level from which egg is dropped
