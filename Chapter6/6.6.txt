 On each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker

 Need to check which locker is open

 A total of 100 lockers are present

 Solution::-

 A door n is toggled once for each factor of n, including itself and 1. That is, door 15 is toggled on rounds 1,3,5, and 15.

 A door is left open if the number of factors (which we will call x) is odd

 The value x is odd if n is a perfect square.

There are 10 perfect squares. 
You could count them (1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100), or you could simply realize that you can take the numbers 1 through 10 and square them:
1*1, 2*2, 3*3, ..., 10*10 
sTherefore, there are 10 lockers open at the end of this process.
